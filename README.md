# Travel-Logger-App
Created a Full Stack Travel Logger App using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React + Hooks and Mapbox at VS Code.

I have used MapBox API token from my account to get access to the MapBox API, you would need to get your own token and update it on Client\.env

Certain Modules required which can be fetched using NPM:

npm i cors
npm i nodemon
npm i helmet
npm i morgan
npm i eslint
npm i mongoose   
npm i dotenv
npm i express-rate-limit
npm i rate-limit-mongo
